Project Title: TicTacToe 
Tictactoe is a pre-created two-player game. There is a 3 by 3 grid where player 1 can put an X and player 2 can put an O. The aim of the game is to get three Xs or Os in a row. This can be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 

Motivation: 
I decided to do the game TicTacToe because it's such a universal game for all ages. It's simple and not time-consuming. I thought it would be interesting/challenging to learn how to create an interactive game (mouse-clicking on board).

Software Used: Pygame 

Features: One additional feature I used was creating an introduction to explain the game. I created another window, different from the game board, where the player can simply press the space button to go to the board window and start the game. Another feature I decided to use was the use of the mouse to click where each player wants to go corresponding to the board, rather than typing in what column and row the X or O goes. 

Tests/Process: 
As I am new to a beginner at coding, I began learning how to use the basic functions of pygame through the use of the website as well as some YouTube tutorials. I learned the basic setup of code on pygame.
